Key updates include the fixing the messaging. alllowing the loggedin user to see what other users in the databases bio and preference choice , 
adding a button that will send a friend request to a user and test cases to test our already exisiting features, this features improved the user experience and application functionality.

## Unfinished Work
The dashboard still needs to be developed. it was moved from Sprint 2 due to time constraints and the need to implement the other features first, the request to add a user was unfinished due to time, 
and issues with the messagging page delay it being finished, Additionally, the settings button was placed at the bottom of our priority list, and we simply did not have sufficient time to address it.
Due to time we also couldnt get ti Refresh Ability, for messages
