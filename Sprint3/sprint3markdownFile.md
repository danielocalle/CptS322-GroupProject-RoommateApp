## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This week, progress was made on enhancing the functionality of the Roommate App and adding a couple of features to try and wrap up the sprint. 
Key updates include fixing the messaging page (backend), allowing the logged in user to see the bios and preferences of other users in the database, adding a button which sends a friend request to a user, and test cases to test existing features.
These features improved the user experience and application functionality.

---

## Unfinished Work
The dashboard still needs to be developed. It was moved from Sprint 2 due to time constraints and the need to implement other features first.
The request to add a user is unfinished due to time and issues with the messaging page which delayed its completion.
Additionally, the settings button was placed at the bottom of our priority list, and we simply did not have sufficient time to address it.
Due to time we also could not implement a refresh utility for messages.
